# Libgdx-Game
My first game

As noted in the description, this is my first game using LIBGDX and my first upload to github.

I've been having dificulties exporting/uploading a .jar file for easy viewing, due to the fact
that libgdx requires certain gradle plugins.

Therefore I'm only including the source code for I feel it will demonstrate the quality of my code 
which, in my opinion, is more important than the final result. 

In terms of content, libgdx with the eclipse IDE packages your textures (e.g. images and audio files)
into the Android folder under "assets", even when you want to run the game under Desktop, html, or ios. 
Thus I included it, but the bulk of the code I wrote is under /core/src/ and I tested it using the Desktop
application.

The game is a simple one that involves bars moving up the screen and the user trying to keep falling so as to 
avoid the top of the screen. The project demonstrated use of a camera to simulate vertical movement, movement from
one side of the screen to the other, GUI elements for menu interactions, lots of collision detection, and much more.
